# Scripts Inventory

Every script under `scripts/`, `scripts/mrf/`, `scripts/cms/`, and the harvest
helpers in `.harvest/` — what each is, how to run it, what it writes, whether
it's resumable, whether it's cron-able, and its status. The two schedulers
themselves (`ops/harvest/runner.mjs`, `install.sh`) and the jobs they run live in
[`OPERATIONS.md`](./OPERATIONS.md); this file is the catalog of the tools they
call and the one-offs alongside them.

**Conventions.** Almost every `.mjs` runs `node --env-file=.env.local <script>`
and connects to Neon via `neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL)`. Bulk federal loaders
(`ingest-nppes-full`, `ingest-form5500`) use **psql COPY** instead — the HTTP
driver dies at the 300 s ceiling on multi-million-row loads. "Resumable" means
safe to re-run after an interruption (usually via idempotent upsert). **Status:**
*active* (part of a live workflow) · *one-off* (ran once / occasional) ·
*superseded* (kept for reference, not the current path).

> Repo is the source of truth; this file is mirrored to a Linear Document.

## Rates / MRF pipeline (`scripts/mrf/`)

The core supply-side pipeline: scan a payer's Transparency-in-Coverage file →
CSV → `provider_rate_signals`. The runners are what harvestd invokes per manifest.

| Script | Purpose | Invocation | Writes to | Resumable | Cron-able | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `scan-tic.mjs` | **The core scanner** — fast single-pass TiC scan, filtered to our NPIs × the behavioral CPT set; emits CSV. `--codes=all` drops the CPT panel (emit every code any of our NPIs price — NYS-50, founder-ruled breadth; measure one dense file first); `SCAN_DIAG=1` names each big allocation pre-parse for OOM forensics | piped: `… \| gunzip -c \| node scan-tic.mjs --npis= --out= --payer= --network= --source-file= --file-date= [--codes=all]` | CSV / stdout | per-file | via harvestd (manifest) | active |
| `stream-uhc-behavioral.mjs` | Reference TiC streamer scan-tic is validated against (~50× slower) | `… \| node stream-uhc-behavioral.mjs --npis= --out= …` | CSV | per-file | no | superseded (kept as the correctness oracle) |
| `load-rate-signals.mjs` | Load scan-tic CSVs into the rate corpus | `node … load-rate-signals.mjs --as-of= file.csv [more…]` | `provider_rate_signals` | idempotent (ON CONFLICT) | via harvestd (`<name>.txt`) | active |
| `stream-load.mjs` | Read scan-tic CSV from **stdin** and batch-insert (no disk) — for files too big for local disk (Aetna) | `… scan-tic --out=- \| node stream-load.mjs --as-of=` | `provider_rate_signals` | idempotent | via harvestd (`stream-`) | active |
| `run-payer.sh` | Generic manifest runner (`url\|decomp\|payer\|network\|slug\|filedate[\|zerook[\|codes]]` lines) → scan → load. `decomp` ∈ `gz`/`zip`/`none` + **`rl`/`ziprl`** — refs-LAST files (UBH/Optum + Oscar generators put `provider_references` AFTER `in_network`): downloaded to a temp file, then the refs section is streamed first so the scanner's phase model holds (`--payer=auto` can't work on a reordered stream — label explicitly) | `bash run-payer.sh <manifest> <outdir>` | CSVs → `provider_rate_signals` | per-file | via harvestd | active |
| `run-stream.sh` | Streaming manifest runner: curl → gunzip → scan `--out=-` → stream-load | `bash run-stream.sh <manifest> <label> <as-of>` | `provider_rate_signals` | per-file | via harvestd (`stream-`) | active |
| `run-two-pass.sh` | Two-pass runner for ref-dense files — Empire 39-series (NYS-25). **Downloaded once to disk** (resumable, retried) then scanned twice from the local copy (pass A collects group-ids, pass B emits); disk beats streaming for the 60+ GB empire2/highmark2 chunks CloudFront kills mid-refs (curl exit 56) — from disk, ~2 min/pass at <300 MB heap | `bash run-two-pass.sh <manifest> <outdir>` | `provider_rate_signals` | per-file | via harvestd (`2p-`) | active |
| `run-oxford.sh` | One-off Oxford sweep (the LLC/CT/OHI entity triplets) | `bash run-oxford.sh` | CSVs | no | no | one-off |
| `repair-carelon.mjs` | Stream filter — escapes unescaped quotes in Carelon/Beacon `business_name` values so the JSON parses | `cat beacon.json \| node repair-carelon.mjs \| node scan-tic.mjs …` | stdout (stream) | n/a | pipe stage | active |
| `extract-anthem-ny.mjs` | Anthem/Elevance ToC miner — stream the 10.5 GB index, keep the first signed URL per NY basename | `curl … \| gunzip -c \| node extract-anthem-ny.mjs > files.txt` | file (URL list) | no | no | active (harvest prep) |
| `load-tin-names.mjs` | Load the MRF `business_name` sidecar into `tin_registry` (the payer's own naming — outranks inference for ein-TINs) | `node … load-tin-names.mjs file.csv --source=cigna-mrf [--dry-run]` | `tin_registry` | idempotent | post-scan | active |
| `ingest-plans.mjs` | Ingest employers + plans from a payer ToC metadata file (demand side, NYS-36) | `node … ingest-plans.mjs --meta= --entity=` | `employers`, `plans` (sql/020) | idempotent upsert | no | active |
| `rollup.mjs` | **The morning report** — coverage numbers with the hygiene rules (distinct NPIs, deduped medians); read-only | `node … mrf/rollup.mjs` | none (the log is the deliverable) | n/a | **yes — `rates-rollup` daily** | active (cron) |
| `report.mjs` | MRF PoC analysis of one scan-tic CSV vs participation (read-only) | `node … mrf/report.mjs --csv=` | none | n/a | no | one-off (analysis) |
| `oxford-uniques.mjs` | Oxford coverage join — how many Oxford NPIs have no other signal anywhere (read-only) | `node … oxford-uniques.mjs *.csv` | none | n/a | no | one-off (analysis) |
| `count-ny-licensed.mjs` | Stream NPPES, count individuals holding a NY license on a behavioral taxonomy (counts only) | `curl … \| node mrf/count-ny-licensed.mjs --npis= --out-npis=` | none (writes an NPI list file) | n/a | no | active (analysis) |

## NPPES / directory (`scripts/`)

The identity foundation — the national registry, the NY behavioral distillation,
and the enrichments on top.

## Organizations / TIN naming (`scripts/`)

Turning bare TINs and NPI-2s into named entities — the naming layer behind every
org display name (see the NYS-27 / NYS-41 lineage).

| Script | Purpose | Invocation | Writes to | Resumable | Cron-able | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `ingest-orgs.mjs` | NPPES NPI-2 organization ingest (NY orgs + national platform tail) | `curl … \| bsdtar … \| node ingest-orgs.mjs --npi-tins=` | `nppes_organizations` (sql/025) | idempotent upsert on npi | monthly | active |
| `orgs-sync.mjs` | Org-layer sync (3 steps: affiliations → org rollups → refresh). **Step 1 needs psql at Anthem scale (NYS-65)** | `node … orgs-sync.mjs [--skip-affiliations] [--skip-refresh]` | `organizations` / `org_tin_*`, `tin_registry` | idempotent per step | post-ingest | active |

**Post-ingest naming routine (order matters):** `orgs-sync.mjs` →
`backfill-tin-names.mjs` → `nppes-name-groups.mjs` → REFRESH `rate_table_mv`
(sql/027 reads `display_name` from `tin_registry`).

## Payer FHIR directories (`scripts/`)

Da Vinci Plan-Net participation harvests — who is in which network.

| Script | Purpose | Invocation | Writes to | Resumable | Cron-able | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## CMS benchmark (`scripts/cms/`)

The Medicare fee schedule — the denominator every "% of Medicare" number
divides by. See `scripts/cms/LICENSE_NOTE.md` for the CPT-descriptor rule.

## Ops instruments (`ops/`)

Not data loaders — the fleet's own instruments. Live under `ops/`, invoked on
demand (or by a session hook), never scheduled.

| Script | Purpose | Invocation | Writes to | Resumable | Cron-able | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `usage-gauge.mjs` | **The fleet fuel gauge** (NYS-123) — reads each Claude account's 5-hour rate-limit window (statusline snapshot → probe → token proxy) and prints a GREEN/AMBER/RED verdict; exit code = worst verdict (0/10/20/30). Pure local file reads, no network. The pacing policy it feeds is [`docs/ops/PACING.md`](./PACING.md) | `node ops/usage-gauge.mjs [--json] [--account <substr>]` | none (read-only) | n/a | on demand / SessionStart hook | active (new) |

## Scripts we still need

- **Per-payer manifest builders** (NYS-107, *Zero-touch*) — one small builder per
  non-walled payer that walks its stable ToC index and drops a ready manifest
  into `.harvest/mrf/manifests/queue/`, killing the last human step for that
  payer. Registered as a `manifest-builders` job in `jobs.json` once it exists.
- **Monthly re-harvest scheduler** (NYS-108, *Zero-touch*) — re-drops each
  payer's manifest monthly (gated on the ToC's published date) so a fresh
  `file_date` lands as new rows, turning point-in-time rates into longitudinal
  history.
_(`db-atlas.mjs` graduated — it's the weekly `db-atlas` job now, keeping
`docs/data/DATABASE.md` and the Obsidian atlas in sync with the live schema.
See the Docs/schema row above.)_
